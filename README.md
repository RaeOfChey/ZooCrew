## Description
ZooCrew is a TypeScript-based application that tracks zoo animals and employees using OOP principles. Easily manage species, employee records, feeding schedules, and payroll with a modular, fault-tolerant system. Built with Inquirer.js for interactive CLI input.

## Features
- Create and manage records for various zoo animals, including their species, hunger status, and weight.
- Track employee details, such as name, ID, title, and salary, while implementing a pay system.
- Implement a modular structure using classes and interfaces to promote code reuse and maintainability.
- User-friendly command-line interface to facilitate interaction with the application.
- Persistent storage of animal and employee records for future reference.

## Installation
To use the application, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Clone the repository.
- Step 2: Navigate to the project directory by typing `cd zoo-crew`.
- Step 3: Once you're inside the folder, install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Usage

When you execute this command, the application will launch in your web browser. You can then:
- Add a new animal by entering its species, hunger status, weight, and feeding amount.
- Create a new employee by providing their name, ID, title, and salary.
- Feed the animals by invoking the feedAnimals() method, which will check and report on the animals' hunger status.
- Pay employees using the payEmployees() method, which prompts you for payment amounts based on the entered employee names.
